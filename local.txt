Big data and AI have a special relationship. Recent breakthroughs in AI development stem mostly from “machine learning.” Instead of dictating a static set of directions for an AI to follow, this technique trains AI by using large data sets. For example, AI chatbots can be trained on data sets containing text recordings of human conversation collected from messenger apps to learn how to understand what humans say, and to come up with appropriate responses (Pandey 2018). One could say that big data is the raw material that fuels AI algorithms and models.

The main constraint on innovation is no longer the difficulty in recording and storing information, but the finding of useful insights among the sheer abundance of data now being collected. AI can notice patterns in mammoth data sets that are beyond the ability of human perception to detect. In this wa
